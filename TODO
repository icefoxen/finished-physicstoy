Better temperature
UI --like, config file that doesn't involve recompilation
Pressure factor --scales size of atoms

A wall temperature and ambient temperature would be interesting, too.  Or at
least provide an easier way to get the energy level you want.

Vary the timestep based on the fastest-moving atom?


Compounds!
Diff sizes, different forces... oh, and toss in some dross that doesn't react
at all.
Play with different force factors --linear, log, exponential, etc.

Someday, maybe, if it's worth it:
Gravity?
Rotation
Springs
